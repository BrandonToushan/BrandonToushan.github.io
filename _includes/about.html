			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p class = "font-weight-light">I'm Brandon. I am a recent Queen's University grad with a background based in Physics, Mathematics and Statistics. Professionally, my passion lies in software development and  
			data analysis. I am most excited about my work when I am working to help find data and technology based solutions to real-world problems to help enrich the lives of others. I have a particular interest in
			healthcare, wellness and outreach based applications and it is my long term-goal to be able to help bring data based problem solving and technical know-how to these areas.
			On the technical side of things, I have extensive experience working with large datasets, developing mathematical and computational models and applying machine learning concepts to a variety of problems.
			I am quite proficient with Python, HTML and CSS and and I am presently improving my ability with Java. If you scroll down you will find some examples of some of my more interesting projects, most notably my work on the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment. Beyond this feel free to check out my Github for a larger sample of my work.<br>
			
			On the more human side of things, I have always loved working with people and as such possess some considerable experience in this regard. During my time at the KidsAbility Centre for Child Development (a wonderful
			NGO primarily concerned with the education and wellness of exceptional learners) I was fortunate enough to find myself interacting with clients, planning camps and simply managing the day to day of leading a team. 
			All in all, this experience in management was extremely positive for me and is something that I would relish the opporunity to do again. Following this, my passion for working with clients has continued on into my current work
			as a freelance developer. I have come to find that forming and maintaining strong client relationships has been the most critical piece in my success as a freelancer and I'd like to believe that this is something that
			I am getting better and better at this as time goes on.<br>
			 
			At the moment, you'll find me working on webpages for several clients, honing my ability with Tableau and brushing up on my Norwegian when I can find the time.
			I'm always in the market for new challenges and opportunties so please feel free to contact me if you have a project or team that you believe I can help with!

			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p class = "font-weight-light">I'm Brandon. I am a recent Queen's University grad with a background based in Physics, Mathematics and Statistics. Professionally, my passion lies in software development and  
			data analysis. I am most excited about my work when I am working to help find data and technology based solutions to real-world problems to help enrich the lives of others. I have a particular interest in
			healthcare, wellness and outreach based applications and it is my long-term goal to be able to help bring data based problem solving and technical know-how to these areas.
			On the technical side of things, I have extensive experience working with large datasets, developing mathematical and computational models and applying machine learning concepts to a variety of problems.
			I am quite proficient with Python, HTML and CSS and I am presently improving my ability with Java. If you scroll down you will find examples of some of my more interesting projects, most notably my work on the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment. At the moment, you'll find me working on webpages for several clients, honing my ability with Tableau and brushing up on my Norwegian when I can find the time.
			I'm always in the market for new challenges and opportunties so please feel free to contact me if you have a project or team that you believe I can help with, a question, or would just like to chat!

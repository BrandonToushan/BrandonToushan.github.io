			<hr class = "primary" align = "left" width = "50%"></hr>
			<p class = "font-weight-light tab"> Hi! I'm Brandon, a data scientist and developer currently living right in the middle of the Waterloo-Toronto tech corridor. I got my start in the tech world from Physics (I used
				to mess around with some extremely cold liquids and some even more extremely priced tubes). Along the way I picked up a considerable  math, stats and cs background which I love to use solving interesting problems 
				with even more interesting solutions. Since then I've been lucky enough to meet and become involved with some amazingly brilliant people, while picking up experience doing all kinds of amazing work with software, data, and machine learning in the process.
				At the moment, I'm heavily involved in the development of a suite of humanitarian data collection and visualization tools with a team out of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, the creation of an algorithmic forex trading model for a small hedge
				fund, in addition to a wholly personal venture which sees me developing CNN powered satellite image tech for the Canadian Red Cross.			</p>

			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p class = "font-weight-light">I am a recent Queen's University grad with a passion for developing data-based solutions for education, healthcare and wellness-based applications. 
			My particular focus is in transforming raw datasets into beautiful, easy to understand visuals and metrics in order to make data-based problem-solving more accesible to those 
			from non-technical backgrounds. My educational background and experience is largely rooted in physics, mathematics, and statistics with the bulk of my past projects and knowledge stemming from these fields. 
			In this capacity, I have extensive experience developing mathematical models and machine-learning algorithms for various scientific applications, most notably the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment. On the more human side of things, I have considerable experience both working in, and managing teams 
			at the KidsAbility Centre for Child Development, a wonderful NGO located at the intersection of wellness, healthcare, education and accesibility. At the moment, I'm currently
			working on several commisioned web development projects, improving my ability with Java and practising my NÃ¸rwegian as much as I can. I'm always in the market for new challenges and opportunties
			so please feel free to contact me if you have a project that you believe I can help with. You'll find some of my past projects below, feel free to 
			give me a shout if you have any questions about me, SuperCOOP or would just like to chat!

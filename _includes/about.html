			<h2>About me</h2>
			<hr class = "primary" align = "left" width = "50%"></hr>
			<p class = "font-weight-light tab">I'm Brandon. I'm a current Global Master of Management Analytics student at the Smith School of Business and a Queen's Physics & Mathematics alumni.
			Professionally, my passion lies in data science and software development. I am most excited about my work when I am working to help find data and technology based solutions to real world problems in order to enrich the lives of others. I have a particular interest in
			global development, healthcare, wellness and outreach based applications and I hope to be able to help bring data based problem solving to these areas.
			On the technical side of things, I have extensive experience working with large datasets, developing mathematical and computational models and applying machine learning concepts to a variety of problems.
			I am quite proficient with Python, R, HTML & CSS and I am presently improving my ability with Java. Scroll down to find examples of some of my more interesting projects, most notably my work on the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment. At the moment, I am currently on internship with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative working on the KoBo Toolbox project as a Software Engineer.
			I'm always in the market for new challenges & opportunities, so please feel free to contact me if you have a project or team that you believe I can help with, a question, or would just like to chat.

			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I am a recent grad with a keen interest in developing data-based solutions for educational, healthcare and wellness-based applications. 
			I am particularily passionate about breaking down complex, abstract datasets into beautiful, easy to understand visuals and metrics. 
			My educational background and experience is largely rooted in physics, mathematics, and statistics based with the bulk of my past projects stemming from these areas. 
			In this capacity, I have extensive experience developing mathematical models and machine-learning algorithms for various scientific applications, most notably the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment. Beyond the technical, my background is largely interpersonal. I am currently finishing up the BEd. program
			at Queen's University in an effort to grow as a person and complement my technical strengths with some international experiences. At the moment, I'm currently
			working on learning Slicer, improving my ability with CSS and preparing for my upcoming practicum in Norway. You'll find some of my past projects below, feel free to 
			give me a shout if you have any questions about me, SuperCOOP or would just like to talk.

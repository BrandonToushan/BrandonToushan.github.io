			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p class = "font-weight-light">I'm Brandon. I am a recent Queen's University grad with a background based in Physics, Mathematics and Statistics. Professionally, my passion lies in software development and  
			data analysis. I am most excited about my work when I am working to help find data and technology based solutions to real-world problems to help enrich the lives of others. I have a particular interest in
			healthcare, wellness and outreach based applications and it is my long term-goal to be able help bring data based problem solving and technical know-how to these areas.
			On the technical side of things, I have considerable experience working with large datasets, developing mathematical and computational models and applying machine learning concepts to a variety of problems.
			I am quite proficient with Python, HTML and CSS and and I am presently improving my ability with Java. If you scroll down you will find some examples of my more interesting projects, most notably my work on the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment.<br>
			
			On the more human side of things, I have considerable experience both working in, and managing teams 
			at the KidsAbility Centre for Child Development, a wonderful NGO located at the intersection of wellness, healthcare, education and accesibility. At the moment, I'm currently
			working on several commisioned web development projects, improving my ability with Java and practising my NÃ¸rwegian as much as I can. I'm always in the market for new challenges and opportunties
			so please feel free to contact me if you have a project that you believe I can help with. You'll find some of my past projects below, feel free to 
			give me a shout if you have any questions about me, SuperCOOP or would just like to chat!

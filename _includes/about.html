			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>I am a recent grad with a keen interest in developing data-based solutions for educational, healthcare and wellness-based applications. 
			I am particularily passionate about breaking down complex, abstract datasets into beautiful, easy to understand visuals and metrics. 
			My educational background and experience is largely rooted in physics, mathematics, and statistics based with the bulk of my past projects stemming from these areas. 
			In this capacity, I have extensive experience developing mathematical models and machine-learning algorithms for various scientific applications, most notably the SuperCOOP project; 
			a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment. Beyond the technical, my background is quite intrapersonal based. I am currently finishing up the
			BEd. program at Queen's University where I continue to improve on how I can best portray information to others
				I have a particular passion for working with people to find solutions and make data accessible and understandable to those
			from from all manner of technical and non-technial backgrounds. I am currently in the midst of a BEd. program in an effort to learn more abou
			can best combine and place a particular emphasis on data visualizaio

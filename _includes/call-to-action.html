                    based with the bulk of my past projects stemming from these areas. In this capacity I have extensive experience developing mathematical models and machine-learning
                    algorithms for various scientific applications, most notably the SuperCOOP project; a recreation of the 1972 Nobel Prize-winning BCS theory experiment.
                    Beyond the technical, I have a particular passion for working with people to find solutions and make data accessible and understandable to those
                    from from all manner of technical and non-technial backgrounds. I am currently in the midst of a BEd. program in an effort to learn more about I
